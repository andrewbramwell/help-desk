**What is ‘Collection’?**<br>
Collection is a fulfilment option allowing a customer to place an order which they will pick up from a specified collection point. This could be a voucher, or even a bulky item such as a luxury food & beverage hamper.

**To enable collection**<br>

1. From the left hand navigation click FULFILMENT > [Fulfilment options]

Here you will find all of the options for the fulfilment of your store.

2. Expand the [Delivery options] tab and select the ‘Manual collection’ check box to activate.
