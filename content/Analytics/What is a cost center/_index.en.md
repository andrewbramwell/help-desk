A cost centre is a role or department that costs the business money but does not generate revenue on its own. They are often marketing or customer service roles. 

In Voucherstore cost centres are a way to allocate free vouchers to a specific department or function of your business, i.e marketing.

As an example, if you wanted to run a campaign distributing ฿10,000 worth of vouchers to 50 loyal customers, then this campaign would incur a cost to your business. 

In this instance you could create a cost centre called ‘Marketing’. Now any vouchers which are issued as part of this campaign would be identifiable, meaning you can easily allocate a cost or spend and better measure the results of your marketing efforts.

This could also apply to customer service and complaints, staff could issue a voucher to an unhappy customer from the ‘Complaints’ cost centre.
