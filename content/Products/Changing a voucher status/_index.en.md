A voucher can be changed to a number of different statuses;

--- | ---
**Expired** | The voucher has not been used and has exceeded the time given for it to be used.
**Issued**| 	The voucher has been created and is currently valid for use.
**Redeemed**| The voucher has been used.
**Refunded**| The voucher can no longer be used and the customer has been issued a refund.
**Cancelled**| The voucher has been cancelled and will not be able to be used.
**Re-issued**| The voucher may have been lost/stolen, re-issuing a voucher will generate a new voucher number and will stop the old voucher from being able to be used.
