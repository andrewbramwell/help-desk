There are 2 types of email that the system can send automatically after a purchase;

**Order receipt email**<br>
This is a digital receipt (not a voucher) which is always issued to the Buyer upon purchasing a product from your online store.

**Email to delivery recipient**<br>
If the Buyer requested the voucher is delivered electronically this email is automatically sent to the Recipient. A link to download the E-vouchers is included with this email.

Your Voucherstore dashboard will include a ready made template for both emails. If you wish to customise the templates, follow the steps below;
